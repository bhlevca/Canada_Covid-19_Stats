These are time series plot of COVID 19 cases in all the provinces, territories and Canada. The goal is to see what the cases and deaths growth rate is, and whether actions by the federal and provincial governments are having an effect on the evolution of the pandemic in Canada.

__To visualize the graphs described below please scroll in the bottom panel:__
* Reverse ranking for the first 5 provinces for total cases, total deaths, new cases and newdeaths
* Total cases, total deaths, new cases and newdeaths for each of the provinces and territories and Canada
* Daily rate of growth starting February 2020
* Comparative cummulative cases in all provinces
* Prediction for the next 30 days in 4 most hit provinces based on the averaged growth rate from the last 5 days. This is a worst case scenario, for now/.


__Work in progress:__
* include recovery statistics
* include testing statistics
* include predictive analysis based on the generalized SEIRS infectious disease dynamics models with extensions that model the effect of factors including population structure, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining detected cases.
